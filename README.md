<h1> Amazon Clone </h1>

This is a clone of the popular e-commerce website Amazon. The project aims to replicate the main features and design of the Amazon website, providing users with a familiar and intuitive shopping experience. The clone is built using HTML and CSS, and it includes various sections such as the navigation bar, search functionality, product categories, and a footer with links to different pages.

The navigation bar at the top of the page includes options for signing in, managing accounts, and accessing the shopping cart. It also features a search bar where users can enter keywords to search for products. The main section of the website displays different product categories, each represented by a box with an image and a "See more" link.

The project focuses on responsive design, ensuring that the website looks and functions well on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Media queries have been used to adapt the layout and styling based on the screen size.

To run the project, simply clone the repository and open the HTML file in a web browser. You can explore the different sections of the website, search for products, and experience the overall user interface.

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding more features, enhancing the design, or implementing additional functionalities. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.
